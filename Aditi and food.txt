Aditi and Food
It was a rainy morning in Sambolia, a small village where little Aditi lived.
She woke up hoping her mother had cooked her favourite food.
But when she saw plain vegetables instead, Aditi frowned.

At school, she pushed her plate away and, without thinking, tossed the vegetables out of the window.

That evening, Aditi walked home through the forest.
Raindrops dripped from the trees, and her tummy rumbled.
Suddenly, she spotted something amazing—
a huge tree with shining leaves and colourful fruits!

It was Maya – the Magical Tree.

“Hello, Aditi,” said Maya with a gentle smile.
“Are you hungry?”

Aditi nodded quickly. She climbed the tree and picked two juicy fruits.
After eating, she leaned against Maya’s trunk and felt warm and safe.

Maya whispered, “Come with me. I want to show you something.”
Before Aditi knew it, they were in a place where rain poured down.
But not a drop touched her—Maya’s big branches sheltered her like an umbrella.

“Wow!” laughed Aditi, jumping into puddles.

Soon, her tummy grumbled again. Maya led her to a small bench and gave her more fruits.
As Aditi munched happily, she saw an old lady nearby.
The lady was eating something from her hands, quickly and hungrily.

Aditi squinted…
Her heart sank.
They were the same vegetables she had thrown away in the morning.

Maya’s voice grew soft.
“Sometimes, poor people have nothing to eat. They pick up whatever food they find. In the rainy season, even animals struggle to find food.”

Aditi felt her eyes fill with tears. She thought of the old lady… and of the food she had wasted.

When she reached home, she told her mother everything.
“I promise, Amma,” she said, “I will never waste food again.”

The next day, Aditi, her mother, and some friends cooked warm meals and gave them to people in need.
They even left food for stray animals under dry roofs.

From that day on, Aditi remembered Maya’s words.

Dear children, food is precious. Never waste it, and always share with those who are hungry—especially in rainy days when finding food is hardest.
