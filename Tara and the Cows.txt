The Magical Tree

Once upon a time, deep within a lush green forest, stood a magnificent tree named Maya. But Maya was no ordinary tree — she had magical powers. Anyone who fell asleep beneath her shade would enter a dreamland, a world where Maya could speak directly to them, sharing wisdom and gentle lessons about life.

One warm summer morning, a little girl named Tara was playing with her friends near the edge of the forest. In the middle of their game, her ball rolled away and disappeared into the woods. Tara chased after it and found it resting beneath a large, shady tree — none other than Maya herself. Tired from the run and soothed by the cool shade, Tara unknowingly dozed off beneath the tree.

And that’s when the magic began.

In her dream, Tara found herself in a place that looked a lot like her village, but brighter and more peaceful. Her stomach grumbled with hunger, and just then, Maya appeared before her, holding a glowing fruit.

“Tara, take this,” said the tree with a gentle voice.

Tara stepped back, eyes wide. “You can talk? And walk?” she asked, startled.

“Don’t be afraid,” Maya said with a warm smile. “This is a dreamland — a special place that shows you how to become a kind, thoughtful person.”

Tara took the fruit and ate it. It was delicious. Feeling safe and curious, she walked alongside Maya.

Soon, they reached a beautiful green field where cows grazed and played freely. Tara was overjoyed. She ran to the cows, laughing and petting them. She hugged them tightly and whispered, “I’ll come back tomorrow to play again.” As the dream faded and she woke up, Tara’s heart was full of happiness.

Eager for another adventure, Tara returned to the magic tree the next morning and lay beneath it once more. The magic worked again, and she found herself back in the dreamland. She bounced with joy, ready to see her beloved cows.

But today, things were different.

Instead of green fields, Maya took her to the middle of a noisy, crowded town. The streets were lined with heaps of garbage — plastic bags, paper, leftover food, and broken things scattered everywhere.

Tara frowned. “Maya, why are we here? I want to play with the cows in the fields.”

Maya gently replied, “Tara, the cows in your village are lucky to have green fields. But in towns and cities, many cows roam the streets, searching for food. Do you know what they find?”

Tara shook her head. “No…”

Just then, a group of cows wandered toward the garbage heaps and began eating the waste — plastic wrappers, paper, rotten food, and even metal scraps. Tara’s eyes filled with tears.

“No! They can’t eat this! It’s so dirty... it’s dangerous!” she cried.

Maya nodded sadly. “Yes, Tara. Many cows suffer like this every day. When they eat plastic and waste, it chokes them. They fall sick and even die. And the milk we get from them can also carry traces of the harm we caused. This is why we must take care of not just cows, but all animals — and our surroundings too.”

Tara went home with a heavy heart, but her spirit was strong. She knew what she had to do.

Spreading Change

That very evening, Tara gathered her friends and spoke to the grown-ups in her village. Together, they cleaned up their surroundings and planted grass patches where animals could graze safely. They placed dustbins in key places and created colorful posters that read:

"Protect Animals — Throw Waste in the Bin!"
"Say No to Plastic on Roads!"

They even visited nearby towns and spread the word, teaching others how to care for animals and the environment.

Later, Tara returned to the magic tree and smiled. “Thank you, Maya, for showing me the truth. I will keep spreading your message and protect all living beings.”

Maya glowed with pride. “You’re already becoming the good person this world needs.”

Dear Young Readers,

Let’s learn from Tara’s story. Always throw waste in dustbins, avoid using plastic, and care for animals who cannot speak for themselves. A cleaner world is a kinder world — for you, for me, and for the creatures who share it with us.

Be like Tara. Be kind. Be magical.
