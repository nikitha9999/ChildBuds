Kabir and the Invisible Bruises

Kabir – a lively, curious boy who enjoys making others laugh but sometimes overlooks when his jokes go too far.

Kabir is playing with his group of friends at school. He often teases another boy named Arjun, calling him “slow” or “weird” — not out of cruelty, but because it makes others laugh. He doesn't think it hurts.

After school, Kabir wanders into the forest near his home, tired and thoughtful. He rests beneath the magical tree, Maya — and soon drifts off to sleep.

In the dreamland, Kabir sees a group of glowing children. But one of them, a boy with a dim, flickering light, is sitting apart from the rest.

Kabir approaches, but when he tries to speak, the boy says nothing. Maya appears beside Kabir and says,
"This child has been hurt — not with sticks or stones, but with words that don’t fade easily."

Kabir is puzzled. Maya gently shows him scenes of the same glowing boy being teased, left out, and laughed at — all the while shrinking smaller and smaller. Kabir suddenly recognizes the boy: it’s Arjun.

He feels a twist in his heart.

Maya says, “Words can bruise a person’s heart. You may forget them… but the other never does.”

Kabir looks down. “I didn’t know it hurt him that much...”

Kabir wakes up under the tree, shaken but wiser. At school the next day, he walks up to Arjun and apologizes. Then he talks to his friends during lunch and says:
"We’re better when we lift others up. Not when we push them down."

He encourages them to speak up against bullying, and makes it a point to include Arjun and others who are often left out.

The story ends with Maya glowing softly in the background, her leaves rustling with quiet pride.

So children, the message is that: 

Words matter. Jokes can hurt. Being kind and speaking up can help someone’s light shine brighter.
