The Neem and the Big Banyan

Once upon a time, in a dark but lovely forest, two trees lived side by side.

One was a small Neem tree—kind, gentle, and helpful.

The other was a big Banyan tree—tall, strong, and very proud of how huge it was.

They had grown together for many years. Birds sang on their branches, and little animals played around their roots.

The Woodcutter Comes

One sunny day, a woodcutter walked into the forest with his shiny axe.

The Neem tree became scared.

It asked the Banyan softly:

“Friend, please hide me with your big branches. I’m afraid the woodcutter will cut me.”

But the Banyan tree, feeling proud and important, pretended not to hear.

It thought,
“I am too big. No one will ever try to cut me.”

Soon, the woodcutter came and cut the little Neem tree.
The forest felt sad… but the Banyan still stood tall and silent.

A Few Months Later…

The woodcutter came again.

This time, he looked up at the big Banyan tree.

Before the Banyan could react, the axe hit its trunk.
The Banyan shook in pain.

Then it saw something surprising:

The handle of the axe was made from the Neem tree’s wood.

The same Neem tree it refused to help.

And soon, the great Banyan tree fell too.

The Lesson

The forest learned something important that day:

Never be too proud to help others.
If you can help, you should.
Kindness always comes back.
